<h1>Semaphore Addins for Microsoft Excel</h1>
<p>
This addins for Microsoft Excel provides an interface to automate importing output data from Century/Daycent modelling to Excel spreadsheets for further processing and/or visualization.
Instead of manually opening each output file and converting it to a sheet, use this tool to import all the available output files in a specified directory with a single click. 
Each file will be converted into a seperate sheet on the active workbook.
</p>
<p>
Currently, the addins is only compatible with Windows version of Microsoft Excel.
